## Project Description:
- In this Project, a Netflix Clone page was developed, a Front-End project, using HTML, CSS, Java Script and Jquery. On the page
we found a more advanced design, very objective, and very functional for its purpose, containing a catalog of static films and series,
and an introductory video, making the page dynamic at this stage.

- The project has the functionality of having a catalog of static films and series , having an introductory video showing a series , its name ,
and a brief dynamic description, with a design very close to netflix itself, with a very functional and interactive screen, even though most of it is static, for
be a Front-End project only, but having its dynamics in the intro video of the page.

- Below we have a small instructional video, where we show an example of how the Netflix Clone page works.
